            404 getbinaries: missing packages: container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-21.0.7.0-33.27

            ================
            
            Snippet No. 1 at line #2:

            (worker was i02-ch1d:23)

            ================
            
Explanation:

[Snippet No. 0] : A dependency (container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-21.0.7.0-33.27) was missing during the build.

[Snippet No. 1] : This snippet indicates the worker used during the build was i02-ch1d:23.

The missing dependency is likely the cause of the build failure. To resolve this issue, the container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-21.0.7.0-33.27 package should be installed on the worker node (i02-ch1d:23) before starting the build.

It could be that this package was not present in the base image for the worker node, or it was removed during an update. In either case, it needs to be re-installed or added back to the image to ensure the build can complete successfully.

Additionally, it might be a good idea to double-check the container image's metadata and dependencies to ensure all required packages are properly listed and included. This could help prevent similar issues in the future.

Recommended Solution:

To resolve this issue, install the missing package (container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-21.0.7.0-33.27) on the worker node (i02-ch1d:23) or add it back to the container image used for the build. Checking the container image's metadata and dependencies for accuracy and completeness is also a recommended best practice.
