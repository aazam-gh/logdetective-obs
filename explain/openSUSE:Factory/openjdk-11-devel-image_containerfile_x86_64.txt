Explanation:

[Snippet No. 0] : A 404 error indicates that the required package "container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-11.0.27.0-33.27" could not be found during the build process.

[Snippet No. 1] : This line indicates that the build process was being executed on worker "i02-ch2c:17".

The issue is that the required package "container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-11.0.27.0-33.27" could not be found during the build process. This indicates that the package repository containing this package was either not added to the build environment or was not accessible during the build. To resolve the issue, you should ensure that the correct package repository is added to the build environment and that it is accessible during the build process. You may need to consult your team's or organization's documentation for instructions on how to add and configure package repositories.

Recommended solution:

1. Check the build environment configuration for the correct package repository containing "container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-11.0.27.0-33.27" and make sure it is added to the build environment.
2. Verify that the package repository is accessible during the build process by pinging it from the build environment or checking its availability through the web interface.
3. If the package repository is not accessible, you may need to contact your organization's system administrators or the package repository maintainers for assistance.
4. Once the correct package repository is added and accessible, attempt to rebuild the package.
