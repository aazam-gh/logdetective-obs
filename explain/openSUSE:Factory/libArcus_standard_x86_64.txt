Explanation:
[Snippet No. 0] : The build process encountered an error while compiling the file 'MessageTypeStore.cpp' in the 'src' directory of the 'libArcus' package.

[Snippet No. 1] : The build process finished compiling the file and moved on to the next step.

[Snippet No. 2] : The RPM build process encountered an error with the build stage.

[Snippet No. 3] : An empty snippet, no useful information.

[Snippet No. 4] : The RPM build process reported an error, with the error message coming from the build stage.

[Snippet No. 5] : The virtual machine interaction log started.

[Snippet No. 6] : The virtual machine performed a power off action.

[Snippet No. 7] : The package 'libArcus' failed to build due to an error in the 'i04-ch2a' build stage.

Based on the provided log snippets, it appears that the build process encountered an error during the compilation of the 'MessageTypeStore.cpp' file in the 'libArcus' package. Despite this error, the build process continued and reached the RPM build stage, which also encountered the same error, ultimately resulting in the failure of the 'libArcus' package build. The virtual machine interaction log suggests that the build process was interrupted and a power off action was taken. It is recommended to investigate the cause of the compilation error in the 'MessageTypeStore.cpp' file, ensure all dependencies are met, and attempt to rebuild the package. Additionally, it would be beneficial to review the virtual machine interaction logs to determine if there were any external factors that may have influenced the build failure.
