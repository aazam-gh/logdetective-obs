Explanation:
[Snippet No. 0] : This snippet signifies the start of the build process. No issues here.

[Snippet No. 1] : This snippet indicates the start of VM interaction, which is expected during the build process. No issues here.

[Snippet No. 2] : The make process encountered an error while building the "src/gui/CMakeFiles/fooyin_gui.dir/all" target.

[Snippet No. 3] : This snippet confirms the failure of the "all" target in the build process.

[Snippet No. 4] : This snippet indicates that the build process exited with error code 2.

[Snippet No. 5] : This snippet summarizes the RPM build errors, including the error code 2.

[Snippet No. 6] : The build process is powering off, likely due to the error encountered during the build.

[Snippet No. 7] : This snippet confirms the failure of the "build fooyin.spec" step in the build process.

Issue Explanation:
The build process encountered an error during the construction of the "fooyin_gui" target. This error caused the "all" target to fail and the build process to exit with error code 2. RPM detected this failure and reported it, leading to the termination of the build.

Recommended Solution:
To resolve this issue, the cause of the error during the build of "fooyin_gui" must be identified and addressed. This could involve examining the build logs in greater detail, checking the dependencies of the package, or consulting the relevant documentation or support resources for the software being built. Once the root cause is identified and corrected, the build process should be able to proceed successfully.
