            [   15s] i02-ch1a failed "build evdi.spec" at Tue Jun 10 11:39:44 UTC 2025.

            ================
            
Explanation:

[Snippet No. 0] : The make command encountered an error while building the package, indicated by Error 2.
[Snippet No. 1] : The make command finished building the directory for the Linux kernel.
[Snippet No. 2] : The RPM build process encountered an error during the build phase.
[Snippet No. 3] : Empty log entry.
[Snippet No. 4] : The RPM build process reported an error during the build phase.
[Snippet No. 5] : The VM interaction logs begin.
[Snippet No. 6] : A sysrq (System Request) command was issued to power off the VM.
[Snippet No. 7] : The package "i02-ch1a" failed to build during the execution of the "evdi.spec" file.

The issue appears to be related to the failure of the "i02-ch1a" package to build during the execution of the "evdi.spec" file. The reason for this failure is not indicated in the provided log snippets. The error may be due to a missing dependency, a coding error, or a problem with the build environment. To resolve the issue, it would be necessary to investigate the "evdi.spec" file and the build environment for the "i02-ch1a" package.

The VM power off command appears unrelated to the build failure, and may be a result of an automated build process or a manual intervention.

To solve the issue, try the following steps:

1. Check the "evdi.spec" file for any missing dependencies or incorrect build instructions.
2. Ensure that the build environment for the "i02-ch1a" package is properly configured.
3. Check the error messages generated during the build process for any clues as to the cause of the failure.
4. If the issue persists, consult the package documentation or seek assistance from the package maintainer.
5. After resolving the issue, rebuild the package using the RPM build process.
