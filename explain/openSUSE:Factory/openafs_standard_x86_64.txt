Explanation:

[Snippet No. 0] : The make command at line 2026 of /usr/src/linux-6.15.1-1/Makefile encountered an error during the build process, resulting in error code 2.

[Snippet No. 1] : The make command successfully exited the directory '/home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/openafs-1.8.13.g20250116-build/openafs-stable-1_8_x/obj/default/src/libafs/MODLOAD-6.15.1-1-default-MP'.

[Snippet No. 2] : The RPM build process encountered an error during the %build phase, as indicated by a non-zero exit status.

[Snippet No. 3] : The log does not contain any relevant information from this section.

[Snippet No. 4] : The RPM build process has encountered errors, as indicated by the presence of the "RPM build errors" message.

[Snippet No. 5] : The virtual machine interaction log starts here.

[Snippet No. 6] : The VM issued a sysrq command to shut down the system.

[Snippet No. 7] : The build process for the 'openafs.spec' file failed at Tue Jun 10 11:50:54 UTC 2025.

Explanation and Recommendation:

The build process of the 'openafs' package failed at the 'make' command during the %build phase, and the RPM build logs indicate a non-zero exit status, suggesting an error occurred. The specific error is not apparent from the given log snippets, but the failure of the 'make' command in Linux kernel source (as evidenced by Snippet No. 0) may have caused the issue. To resolve the problem, it is recommended to check the error logs, especially the ones related to the 'openafs' package build, for further information and take corrective actions accordingly. In some cases, it might be necessary to recompile the Linux kernel or update the dependencies to their latest versions before attempting another build. Additionally, a VM shutdown (as indicated by Snippet No. 6) may be an unrelated incident that occurred during the build process. However, it may be worth investigating if the build failure and the VM shutdown are causally related.
