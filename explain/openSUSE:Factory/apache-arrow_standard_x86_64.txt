            [  637s] i04-ch2b failed "build apache-arrow.spec" at Tue Jun 10 11:50:16 UTC 2025.

            ================
            
Explanation:
1. Snippet No. 0 indicates the build process has entered the directory for building the apache-arrow package.
2. Snippet No. 1 shows that the make command encountered an error during the build process, specifically at the "all" target.
3. Snippet No. 2 confirms the error and indicates it resulted in a non-zero exit status.
4. Snippet No. 4 states that there were RPM build errors, with the primary error being the non-zero exit status from the build directory.
5. Snippet No. 5 and No. 6 indicate that the virtual machine interaction has started, but it's unclear if this is related to the build failure.
6. Snippet No. 7 indicates that the build of "apache-arrow.spec" failed.

Issue and Recommendation:
The build process for the apache-arrow package encountered an error during the make command execution, specifically at the "all" target. This led to a non-zero exit status, which caused the RPM build to fail. Further investigation into the error message or examining the build logs before and after this snippet could potentially provide more context and help identify the cause of the issue.

One possible solution could be to check the build requirements, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed and configured. Another option is to examine the makefile for any potential issues, such as incorrect compile flags, missing libraries, or other dependencies not being properly linked. Additionally, checking the build environment, such as the system version and available resources, could help identify potential issues. If necessary, attempting to build the package from source or using a different RPM builder, such as mock, might help isolate and resolve the issue.
