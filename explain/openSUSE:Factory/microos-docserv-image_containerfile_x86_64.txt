Explanation:

[Snippet No. 0] : A 404 error indicates that the required package, "container:opensuse-nginx-1.28-31.6", was not found during the build process.

[Snippet No. 1] : This snippet indicates that there was an error on worker "i04-ch1c:16". However, it doesn't provide any additional information about the nature of the error.

Explanation:

The first snippet reveals that the package "container:opensuse-nginx-1.28-31.6" was not available during the build process, resulting in a failure. The second snippet does not provide any information related to the cause of the failure. It only indicates that there was an error on a specific worker.

To resolve the issue, you need to ensure that the required package, "container:opensuse-nginx-1.28-31.6", is available in the package repository used by the build system. You may need to update your repository or add the missing package to it. Additionally, you could try building the package on a different worker or machine to see if the issue is specific to the failed worker.
