            [   66s] i04-ch2d failed "build leechcraft.spec" at Tue Jun 10 11:41:12 UTC 2025.

Explanation:
[X] : [Y]

Snippet No. 0 : Error message indicating a failure during the build process of the RPM package.
Snippet No. 4 : Confirmation of the failure with a "RPM build errors" message.
Snippet No. 7 : Detailed error message that points to the specific file ("leechcraft.spec") and the build step ("i04-ch2d") that failed.

The unversioned Obsoletes mentioned in Snippets No. 2 and No. 3 are not directly related to the build failure. It's a warning that can be addressed separately.

Issue:
The RPM build process of the 'leechcraft' package failed due to an error in the 'i04-ch2d' build step of the 'leechcraft.spec' file.

Recommended Solution:
Identify the root cause of the issue in the 'i04-ch2d' build step of the 'leechcraft.spec' file. This could include but is not limited to: incorrect dependencies, compiler issues, missing libraries, etc. Once the issue is identified, correct the error and rebuild the RPM package. If the problem persists, seek assistance from the package maintainer or the community for further guidance.
