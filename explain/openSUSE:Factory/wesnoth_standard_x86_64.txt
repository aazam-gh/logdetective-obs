            [  251s] i02-ch2b failed "build wesnoth.spec" at Tue Jun 10 11:44:14 UTC 2025.

Explanation:
1. Snippet No. 0 indicates that the make process is waiting for unfinished jobs to complete before continuing. This is a normal part of the build process.
2. Snippet No. 1 shows that the "all" target in the Makefile failed with an error code 2. This indicates that there was a build error.
3. Snippet No. 2 confirms that there was a build error in the %build section of the rpm spec file.
4. Snippet No. 4 repeats the error message from Snippet No. 2.
5. Snippet No. 5 is a VM interaction message, it does not provide any useful information about the build error.
6. Snippet No. 6 indicates that the virtual machine is being powered off, likely due to an error or failure during the build process.
7. Snippet No. 7 indicates that the build of the "i02-ch2b" package failed when trying to build the "wesnoth.spec" file.

Based on the information provided in the log snippets, it appears that there was a build error in the %build section of the "i02-ch2b" RPM spec file, which caused the build process to fail. The virtual machine was likely powered off as a result of the error. To resolve this issue, the %build section of the "i02-ch2b" RPM spec file should be reviewed to identify and correct the build error. Once the error has been addressed, the RPM build process can be attempted again.
