            [   10s] i03-ch2a failed "build oqs-provider.spec" at Tue Jun 10 11:39:42 UTC 2025.

Explanation:
1. Snippet No. 0 indicates a delay of 10 seconds between build steps. This is normal and does not indicate a failure.
2. Snippet No. 1 shows an error during the build of the OpenSSL Evp Pkey Params library. This error caused the subprocess to abort.
3. Snippet No. 2 indicates that CTest (a testing framework used in CMake) encountered errors during its execution.
4. Snippet No. 3 and Snippet No. 4 both report that there was a bad exit status from the RPM build process, specifically from the %check section.
5. Snippet No. 5 and Snippet No. 6 are unrelated to the build process and show a system shutdown command issued through sysrq.

Issue:
The build process of the i03-ch2a package failed due to an error in the OpenSSL Evp Pkey Params library build (Snippet No. 1), which led to a bad exit status from the RPM build process (Snippet Nos. 3 and 4).

Solution:
To resolve this issue, the OpenSSL Evp Pkey Params library needs to be rebuilt without errors. The root cause of the error should be identified and addressed, such as dependencies not being met, incorrect library versions, or build configuration issues. Once the error is resolved, the package can be rebuilt, and the CTest and RPM build processes should complete successfully. If necessary, consult the OpenSSL documentation or seek help from the OpenSSL community for specific error resolution.
