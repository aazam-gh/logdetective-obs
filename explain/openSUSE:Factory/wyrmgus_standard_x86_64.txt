Explanation:
[Snippet No. 0] : The make process has left the Wyrmgus build directory.

[Snippet No. 1] : The 'CMakeFiles/Makefile2' encountered an error during the 'all' target build.

[Snippet No. 2] : The make process encountered an error, and exited with an error status.

[Snippet No. 3] : The log is empty, suggesting no further relevant information is provided here.

[Snippet No. 4] : The RPM build process has encountered errors during the build of the Wyrmgus package.

[Snippet No. 5] : The virtual machine interaction has started. This is likely an attempt to clean up the failed build.

[Snippet No. 6] : The virtual machine is being powered off.

[Snippet No. 7] : The build failure occurred during the 'build wyrmgus.spec' command.

Based on the provided information, it appears that the Wyrmgus build process encountered an error during the CMake build step, and this error resulted in a failed 'all' target build. This, in turn, caused the RPM build process to fail with a bad exit status. The virtual machine was then powered off in an attempt to clean up the build environment. The exact nature of the error is not provided in the snippets, but it's likely that further investigation would be required to determine the root cause and apply an appropriate solution, such as modifying the build configuration or the Wyrmgus source code.
