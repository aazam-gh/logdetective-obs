Explanation:
[Snippet No. 3] : Error occurred during the execution of a RUN command in the Dockerfile, which resulted in exit status 1.

[Snippet No. 4] : The build command in Podman failed due to the error in the previous RUN command.

[Snippet No. 5] : The system is shutting down due to a sysrq command. This might have been triggered by an error or manual intervention.

[Snippet No. 7] : The error message suggests a failure in building the Dockerfile, which aligns with the information in Snippet No. 3 and No. 4.

Issue Explanation:
An error occurred during the execution of a RUN command in the Dockerfile, which resulted in exit status 1. This error caused the Podman build command to fail. The error message was not provided, but it's mentioned in Snippet No. 3 that the command was "building at STEP" and that it failed. The sysrq command in Snippet No. 5 might have been triggered as a result of the build failure or due to some other reason, leading to the system shutting down.

Recommended Solution:
The first step would be to check the error message in Snippet No. 3 and identify the cause of the RUN command failure. Once the issue is identified, it can be addressed by making the necessary changes to the Dockerfile or the environment where the build is taking place. It might also be helpful to check the logs leading up to the error to gain a better understanding of the situation. After resolving the issue, a new build attempt can be initiated. If the sysrq command was triggered manually, it can be safely ignored.
