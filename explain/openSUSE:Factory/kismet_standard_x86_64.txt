Explanation:

[Snippet No. 0 at line #686]: The build process is checking whether the OpenSSL library can be compiled and linked with the package. Since the check failed, it indicates that the required library is missing or not correctly installed on the system.

[Snippet No. 1 at line #687]: The configure script has encountered an error because it couldn't find the OpenSSL library.

[Snippet No. 2 at line #688]: The RPM build process encountered an error during the %build stage.

[Snippet No. 4 at line #690]: The RPM build process reported that the build stage failed.

[Snippet No. 5 at line #692]: The virtual machine interaction log starts.

[Snippet No. 6 at line #693]: The virtual machine is being powered off.

[Snippet No. 7 at line #696]: The build of 'kismet.spec' failed.

Issue explanation:
The build process of the 'kismet.spec' package failed due to the missing or incorrectly installed OpenSSL library. Without this library, the package cannot be compiled and linked. The configuration script encountered an error during this process as well. The virtual machine was eventually powered off.

Solution:
To resolve the issue, make sure OpenSSL is correctly installed on the system. You can install it using the package manager for your specific distribution. For example, on a Red Hat or CentOS system, you can install it with the command: `sudo yum install openssl-devel`. After installing OpenSSL, you should be able to rebuild the 'kismet.spec' package.
