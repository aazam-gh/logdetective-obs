Explanation:

[Snippet No. 0] : A dependency (container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-17.0.15.0-34.27) was missing during the build process, causing a 404 error.

[Snippet No. 1] : This log snippet indicates that the build process was being executed on a worker named i02-ch1d:23.

The issue occurred due to the missing dependency (container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-17.0.15.0-34.27) during the build process. This dependency is required for the build to succeed, but it was not available, causing the 404 error. To resolve the issue, the missing dependency should be installed or added to the build environment. This can be done by adding it as a requirement in the build configuration, or by manually installing it on the worker node.
