            404 getbinaries: missing packages: container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-24.0.1.0-2.27

            ================
            
            Snippet No. 1 at line #2:

            (worker was i02-ch2c:17)

            ================
            
Explanation:

[Snippet No. 0] : A dependency (container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-24.0.1.0-2.27) was not found during build process.

[Snippet No. 1] : This snippet indicates that the build process was being executed on a worker named i02-ch2c:17.

Issue:
The build process was unable to locate the required package 'container:opensuse-bci-openjdk-24.0.1.0-2.27', leading to a failure.

Solution:
1. Check if the required package exists in the repository or artifact repository being used by the build tool.
2. If the package is not present, it may need to be added to the repository or artifact repository.
3. Alternatively, if adding the package to the repository is not an option, then a different version of the package or an alternative package may need to be used.

In the given scenario, it appears that the package was missing from the repository or artifact repository. The suggested solution would be to add this package to the repository or artifact repository, ensuring it's available for future builds.
