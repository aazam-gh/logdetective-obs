Explanation:
1. The first snippet indicates that the build process was stopped due to a subcommand failure.
2. The second snippet shows that the RPM build process was autodetected as using Ninja as the build system.
3. The fourth snippet confirms that there was an error during the build process, with a bad exit status from the /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.VnHFta (%build) directory.
4. The fifth and sixth snippets suggest that the virtual machine was powered off during the build process.

The issue seems to be that the build process using Ninja as the build system encountered an error, resulting in a bad exit status. This caused the RPM build to fail and the virtual machine to be powered off. It is not clear from the provided information what caused the error during the build process.

Recommendation:
To resolve the issue, it would be necessary to examine the build logs in more detail, starting from the point where the error occurred. This could involve looking for error messages or stack traces that indicate the cause of the problem. Once the cause of the error has been identified, it can be addressed and the build process can be tried again. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to seek further assistance from the upstream project or the community.
