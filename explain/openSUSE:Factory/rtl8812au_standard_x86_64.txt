            [   20s] i02-ch1a failed "build rtl8812au.spec" at Tue Jun 10 11:39:53 UTC 2025.

Explanation:
1. Snippet No. 0 indicates that the build process has started.
2. Snippet No. 1 indicates that the VM interaction has started.
3. Snippet No. 2 suggests that the build process is waiting for unfinished jobs.
4. Snippet No. 3 indicates that the 'modules' target in the Makefile has failed with error code 2.
5. Snippet No. 4 and No. 5 confirm that there was an error during the build process and provide the RPM error message.
6. Snippet No. 6 suggests that an error occurred during the build process and the system is being shut down using sysrq command.
7. Snippet No. 7 indicates that the build of the 'i02-ch1a' package has failed.

Issue:
The build process of the 'i02-ch1a' package has failed with an error during the 'build' step. The exact nature of the error is not clear from the provided snippets, but it resulted in an RPM build error and ultimately the system was shut down using sysrq command.

Solution:
To identify and resolve the build error, the first step should be to examine the error message in the RPM build log more closely. This may provide additional information about the cause of the error. If the error cannot be resolved, it may be necessary to consult the package documentation, or seek assistance from the package maintainers.

Additionally, checking the system logs (such as /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog) may provide more context about what went wrong during the build process. It is also worth checking that all necessary dependencies are installed and up-to-date.

If the issue persists, it may be necessary to try building the package from source in a clean environment, or using a different version of the package or the build tools. Finally, if none of the above solutions work, it may be necessary to consider reporting the issue upstream to the package maintainers.
