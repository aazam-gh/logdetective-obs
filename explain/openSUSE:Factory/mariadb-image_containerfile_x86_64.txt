            [   43s] i03-ch1c failed "build Dockerfile" at Wed Jun 11 16:35:36 UTC 2025.

            ================
            
Explanation:
[Snippet No. 3] : An error occurred during the build process at step 6 out of 8. The command "RUN set -euo pipefail; [ "$(rpm --root /target -q --qf '%{version}' mariadb | cut -d '.' -f -2)" = "11.7" ]" failed with exit status 1.

[Snippet No. 4] : The podman build command itself failed due to the error in the previous step.

[Snippet No. 5] : The system is shutting down, possibly due to an error or an intentional action.

[Snippet No. 7] : The build failed for a Dockerfile named "i03-ch1c". However, there's no information available about the cause of the failure.

Explanation:
The build process encountered an error during the execution of command at step 6. The command is attempting to check the version of MariaDB installed in the target directory and compare it with the expected version "11.7". If the versions don't match, it might cause an error. Given the error message, it looks like the version check command is failing, possibly due to incorrect path to the MariaDB package or other dependencies.

Recommended Solution:
1. Check if the target directory has the correct MariaDB package installed, and if so, check its version against the expected value.
2. Verify the path to the MariaDB package in the Dockerfile is correct.
3. If necessary, update the Dockerfile to handle cases when the version check fails, such as by setting a default version or using a different command to check for the presence of the package.
4. Rebuild the Docker image.
