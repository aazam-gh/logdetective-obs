Explanation:
1. Snippet No. 0 indicates a 28-second pause during the build process.
2. Snippet No. 1 indicates an error occurred during the installation of the 'sqlite3' gem.
3. Snippet No. 2 shows that 'sqlite3' is listed in the Gemfile.
4. Snippet No. 3 and No. 4 indicate an error during the RPM build process for 'sqlite3'.
5. Snippet No. 5 and No. 6 indicate the virtual machine is shutting down.
6. Snippet No. 7 shows a failure during the build of 'h02-ch2d' RPM package.

The primary issue here is the error during the installation of the 'sqlite3' gem, which in turn caused an error during the RPM build process. The virtual machine shutdown might be a result of this failure or could be an unrelated issue. To resolve the problem, you should try to install the 'sqlite3' gem manually, ensuring all dependencies are met. If the issue persists, you may want to look into the RPM build errors or consider using a different SQLite version or alternative SQLite3 gem. Additionally, it may be worth investigating why the virtual machine is shutting down during the build process.
