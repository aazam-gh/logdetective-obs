Explanation:
The RPM build failed because the make command in the Apache Arrow build process returned an error status (exit code 2). This error occurred at the step mentioned in the Snippet No. 1 (line #2990), and the cause was a build error within the Apache Arrow C++ build directory (Snippet No. 0).

The RPM build log does not provide a specific reason for the make command failure, but it seems the build process did not succeed as intended. To troubleshoot further, you would need to investigate the Apache Arrow C++ build logs within the specified directory '/home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILD/apache-arrow-19.0.1-build/arrow-apache-arrow-19.0.1/cpp/build'.

Possible fixes would involve:
- Checking for build dependencies or configuration errors within the Apache Arrow C++ build process.
- Cleaning and rebuilding the Apache Arrow package.
- Investigating the build logs of the individual components within the Apache Arrow C++ build process to identify the specific point of failure.
- Consulting Apache Arrow documentation or community forums for build-related issues.
