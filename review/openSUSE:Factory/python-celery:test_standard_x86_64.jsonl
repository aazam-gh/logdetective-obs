{ "logdetective": "Based on the provided snippets, the build process encountered an error during the %check phase of the RPM build process for the package located in /var/tmp/rpm-tmp.NrwUnP. This error caused the build process to terminate with a non-zero exit status, triggering the power off command. However, it's unclear why this error occurred, and further investigation would be required to determine the root cause. To resolve the issue, one could inspect the error message from the failed RPM build, review the relevant code, and try to recreate the issue in a controlled environment. Additionally, it's possible that there were dependencies or configuration issues that contributed to the problem.", "rank": 2, "review": "Doesn't catch the relevant failure snippet" }
