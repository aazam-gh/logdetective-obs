OBS - Log detective integration tools

Repository to store documentation, scripts and tools for the
integration of [openSUSE openbuild
service](https://build.opensuse.org/) with
[log detective](https://log-detective.com).

The goal is to use and improve the LLM AI from Log Detective for
openSUSE packaging development. So we can have a simple plain text
explanation for build failures.

In the future, if the model is good enough we can even get some kind
of automated tools for categorization of build failures, or even get
some kind of automated request creation with easy fix.

This repository is related to the
[2025 Google Summer of Code project](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/236)
